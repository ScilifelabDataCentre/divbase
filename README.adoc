= divbase-prototyping

Create a mock DivBase implementation, so that we can prototype/test out ideas

This will require an install of MinIO and creation of various accounts with MinIO. 

Then mock projects can be created to test out how versioning and other features work for users.

Can also be used to test out how a DivBase API could look.
