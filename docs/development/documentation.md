# Documentation Generation

Documentation for DivBase is generated using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) along with the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme.

The `mkdocs.yml` at the root of the repository contains the configuration for the docs site and all content inside the `docs/` folder can be used to create the documentation pages.

To add a new page to the documentation site you must add it to the `nav:` section of the `mkdocs.yml` file.

## View documentation locally

To build and serve the documentation locally, you can use the following command:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

The docs will be available at: <http://localhost:8001/divbase/>

If you make changes to the documentation files inside the `docs/` folder, the local server will automatically reload to reflect those changes. Changes to the `mkdocs.yml` file require a restart of the server to take effect.

## Automated CLI documentation generation

Some of the documentation pages, are autogenerated from the codebase. This is covered by a "hook" which runs on initial build of the docs site. Hooks can be defined in the `mkdocs.yml` file. See
`scripts/build_docs.py`.

## Deploying the documentation site

A GH action is set up to automatically build and deploy the documentation site to GitHub pages on workflow dispatch or if a new release is created. The action uses the `mkdocs gh-deploy` command to build and deploy the site.
