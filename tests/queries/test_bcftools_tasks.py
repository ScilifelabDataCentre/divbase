    Integration test in which bcftools_pipe_task is run with a real Celery worker.
    Runs locally using the docker compose testing stack defined and performs a real sidecar and bcftools
    query by loading VCF files from the tests/fixtures dir. It was designed for having RabbitMQ as the broker, Redis as the backend,
    and a custom Celery worker image that has bcftools installed.
    (this test does not download fixture from bucket, since that is handled by the CLI layer)

    Does not assert file download and uploads, since that is handled by tests in tests/cli_commands/test_query_cli.py.
    (but the current version of the task does I/O with files from the bucket, so it is tested indirectly)
