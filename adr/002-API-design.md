# 1. ADR 002: Initial Design of DivBase API

## 2. Status
Proposed

## 3. Context
DivBase API needs to handle all user interactions with the system:
- User and project management.  
- Facilitate upload/download of data files to S3 (users will not have accounts with S3).
- Run queries on the datasets and associated metadata "results files".

**Considerations:**
- The API must support both web-based and CLI-based workflows.
- Users will interact with the object store indirectly via pre-signed URLs generated by the API.
- We are making a CLI tool which handles interacting with the API. Whilst users could use the API directly, we are not optimizing/aiming for that.  
- The API will send a lot of network requests (to/from: user, job management system and S3) so an asynchronous implementation would be ideal.


## 4. Decision
Implemented using FastAPI, with PostgreSQL for the db. The API will handle all user interactions, including:
- Authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- File upload/download operations via pre-signed URLs.
- Job submission and status tracking.
- The API will also provide a basic web interface for user and project management. These endpoints will return [HTMLResponses](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/custom-response/#htmlresponse) using Jinja2 templating. HTMX used where/if needed. 

### 4.1 Web/API Endpoints
The following endpoints will be implemented:

FRONTEND_URLs:
```bash
{register, login, logout, reset_password}/
project/{proj_id} Basic overview, see projects, manage members if project manager
users/: Edit name, email, change password etc...
```

API_URLs:
```bash
/api/v1/{login, logout}/
/api/v1/query/: Submit query or check the status of a query
/api/v1/files/: Create presigned URL for user for S3 upload/download
/api/v1/version/: Utility to version the state of all bucket files
```


### Auth Flows

Propose to use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) as well supported by FastAPI. Can reuse the same auth logic as much as possible for both the Frontend and API.

</p>

  <br>
  <em>Refresh token logic. Unlike the access token, the refresh token logic includes a db lookup to verify that the user is still active and not deleted.</em>
</p>


### CLI vs Web Browser Difference:

The web browser would store the tokens in HttpOnly Cookies. 
The CLI would store the access and refresh tokens on the users local PC, e.g.:

```bash
divbase-cli auth login ...
## tokens auto added to ~/.config/.divbase_cli/.env
divbase-cli query ... # Both tokens passed in HTTP request sent to the DivBase API. 
```

### DB Models - defined with sqlalchemy 2
```bash
Base: # inherited by all other models
  UUID, created_at, updated_at

Users(Base): 
  name, email, hashed_password, is_admin, is_active

Projects (Base): 
    name, description, storage_quota, bucket_name, is_active

ProjectMembership(Base): # To handle many-to-many relationship between users and projects
    user_id, project_id, role*, joined_at, is_active
    # *role would be an enum: {READ, WRITE, MANAGE}

# optional 
- RevokedRefreshTokens(Base) # For if users logs out or want could have this as a blacklist table. 
```

**Why no Jobs Table?** Our current approach is that the DivBase API queries the FlowerAPI for the job status/details and passes that back to the user. (see diagram in [ADR-001](adr/imgs/001-initial-design.png))


## 5. Consequences
Positive:
- FastAPI provides native async support. 
- JWTs can be used by both browser and API (reduced complexity).  
- Pre-signed URLs mean only once place for user administration. 

Negative:
- JWTs being stateless Token revocation requires additional infrastructure. That said users will only have soft delete powers on S3 (so a leaked access/refresh token cannot do too much damage). 
- Dependency on FlowerAPI for job management introduces potential latency.

## 6. Alternatives Considered:

- Django/Flask: Not arguing one is better than the other. Due to the low priority of having a frontend and that the frontend is expected to be quite limited, we have decided to try out FastAPI initially. The admin panel that comes with Django would be one benefit of using Django instead (make viewing users/projects easier). The support for async in FastAPI would be one advantage of using FastAPI.    

- Jobs Table: Instead of relying on the FlowerAPI to parse jobs statuses a Jobs table could be added to the database to track job submissions and statuses. This could provide more control over job management but requires potentially a substational amount of additional dev work.
